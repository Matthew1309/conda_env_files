To make an environment from a file: 
	conda env create -f "RNAseq.yaml"
To make an enviornment:
	conda create --name "name-of-env"

To list all conda environments:
	conda env list

To move to a different conda environment:
	conda activate "name-of-env"

To remove a conda environment:
	conda remove --name myenv --all

To give jupyter a conda env install set
	python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name "Python 3.8 (tensorflow)"

To update a conda env with a newer yml
	activate your env
	conda env update -f environment.yml

To export your current env to yml file
	conda env export > environment.yml
If you want a more succinct version (note doesn't keep channels?)
	conda env export --from-history > environment.yml



To allow for nicer running of R-code in JupyterLab
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56460834/how-to-run-a-single-line-or-selected-code-in-a-jupyter-notebook-or-jupyterlab-ce
This seems like a healful way to create an Rstudio like python kernal.

```Settings --> Advanced Settings Editor --> JSON Settings Editor```
then copy and paste this:
```{
            "command": "notebook:run-in-console",
            "keys": [
                "Ctrl Shift Enter"
            ],
            "selector": ".jp-Notebook.jp-mod-editMode"
},```
